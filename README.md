# Chalaki
Chalaki is a very simple python implementation of the [Patchwork](https://lookout-spiele.de/en/games/patchwork.html) board game by Uwe Rosenberg. :heart:
![Cover of the original board game version](/assets/cover.jpg)\n
It was developed in December 2020 during COVID-19 quarantine, while I was practicing my python skills. The game is played with 2 players alternating turns using the command prompt. Some very basic non-interactive graphics also pop up.

## How to
[PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) is needed for the graphics part. It can be simply installed like this
```
pip install pygame 
```
After navigating to the project directory using the command line, simply run Game.py
```
python Game.py
```

Follow the prompts given in the command prompt window to play through the game\n
**Important**: When prompted to give coordinates for placing a game piece, they should be given in row-column format. For example, topleft is 11, topright is 19, bottomleft is 91 and bottomright is 99. The coordinates of the top left square of the piece should be given (look at the command prompt representation of the piece to get a better understanding). Sorry for any confusion caused... :broken_heart:\n
At the end of the game, the score is displayed in the command prompt window.\n\n

Have fun ! ! !\n\n
